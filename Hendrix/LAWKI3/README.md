LAWKI3

This is an updated version of our group LAWKI application but does not include the testing scripts. 

DESCRIPTION:
Application opens with a menu page (see game or Menu) and loads the play scene. First the player must select a character. Several single celled organim options are available with descriptions on their adaptability. Once the character is selected, the game begins. Mutations randomly occur on certain time intervals and the changes in player stats can be seen in the player panal along with an image of the character. In the plain view, the player can use arrow keys to 'move' the character across the map.

ADDITIONS:
The player chooses their character, bacteria, parasite, eukaryote, etc. before entering the game. An image of their character can be seen on the map in place of a sphere. The player panel reflects the player's choice by displaying the chosen character sprite and statistics specific to the organism. 
The player can return to the main menu from the character selection page and the options panal.

REMOVED:
Removed the testing scripts added for the testing assignment.
Removed character selection in the player panal.
Changed weather from key selection to randomly time generated.

KNOWN BUGS:
Transitions between Options panal and menu sometimes causes issues
Project has not been tested on Android.
Running project on Windows leads to errors and distortions.

To Do: 
Fix transition bugs
Give each organism a custom mutation rate
Add more information about the different organism characters

Smoother transitions between maps; decrease transition time
