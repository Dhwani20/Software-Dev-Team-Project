Menu and Scenes v1

Application demonstrates a basic menu that allows the user to alter music settings, quit the application from the menu, and 'start' the game. This application also demonstrates scene changes within the app. Pressing start on the main menu will trigger a change to level 1. Touching the next button will trigger a scene change to level 2. The menu also incorporates panels to display the settings options.

The levels consist of moving a game object with a touchpad. The controls for the first level move the cube forward and backwards and rotates the cube in both directions to enable side and diagonal movement. The controls for the second level move the cube left-right and up-down.

Developed with Unity.
Intended for Android.

Known bugs: When the Android device in rotated, the play field is not large enough and the boundaries are not set (aka, the cube can fall off the edge).

Future Developments for menu:
	Organize settings to reflect our game needs.
	Add options/settings panels to later scenes.
	Add a player panal where the user can view their player stats.
	Incorporate theme to distinguish menu template from Unity Game Jam Template template.
 
Future Developments for movement:
	Extend the floor to fill the side view.
	Add boundaries so the player object does not fall off the edge of the floor.
	Alter buttons to be more intuitive and allow easier diagonal movement.
