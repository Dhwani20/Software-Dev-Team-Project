MoveCharacterWKeys

Application demonstrates (1) movement of the player object using keyboard keys and (2) interactions between objects. The player object 'collects' 12 cubes (makes them disappear) upon collision through the collider component. Like the previous ClientDemo_1 app, this app displays a changing score text that is updated whenever a cube is collected.
