Game

DESCRIPTION
Application demonstrates the framework of our game. The menu contains three option: Quit, Options, and Start. Quit exits the game. Options allos the user to control sound and to quit the game. Start loads the play scene.
The play scene simulates weather alterations by randomly changing the weather property as seen by the icon in the top right. Currently the simulation is dictated by a timer and is triggered once every two seconds; however in the future, this timer may be used to determine when mutations arise. Later these changes will represent the current weather in the user's play area including sunny, rainy, snowy, and cloudy. The weather will affect the player health in later versions of this game.
In the options menu, there is a toggle that when activated, makes a virtual joystick appear. The user can move the player in any direction across the map by clicking or tapping the joystick.
