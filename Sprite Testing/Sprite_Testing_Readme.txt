The script, when attached to an object, (The provided scene contains such an object)
will function as follows:

When the game is running, press any of the numbers 1-6* as inputs and the script will have the object switches to the corresponding sprite 

Pressing an invalid key or an out of range number will display an error sprite.

It's simple, but it allows us to see that the sprites are indeed being loaded correctly.

*Note that 1-6 refers to the alphanumeric 1-6 keys (the ones at the top of the keyboard), not the numpad
