### Description: 
In this project, we will be making an app that allows users to connect with not only other users, but also engage students to go outside and interact with their surroundings, as well as have fun while learning about the natural sciences. 

### Vision statement: 
To make learning about the natural sciences more effective and fun.

### Motivation: 
This app would be useful to educate students about the natural sciences and bring more students into STEM based studies.

### Risks:
* It would take a lot of time to make and we potentially might not finish.
* Using new programming languages.
* No prior experience working with the people on the team.

### dealing with the risk: 
This can be dealt with by creating a timeline and updating it at each milestone as well as working together in order to gain experience with working in a team and with different programming languages.

### List of requirements:
1. **(2 hours)** As a teacher, I want helpful context so that my students can access information explaining the science used in the game.
2. **(4 hours)** As a student, I want to be notified when in the vacinity of another player so that I can have the option to engage that player in competition.
3. **(5 hours)** As a student, I want a point system and character statistics so that I can track my progress and be more competative.
4. **(6 hours)** As a developer, I want to develop the wireframe of the components so that I can build the foundation of the graphic design.
5. **(4 hours)** As a developer, I want to establish mutation criteria so that I can establish when and how characters develop.
6. **(3 hours)** As a developer, I want to obtain and incorporate geographic data so that I can define the application's local environment.

### Methodology:
