Description: In this project, we will be making an app that allows users to connect with not only other users, but also engage students to go outside and interact with their surroundings, as well as have fun while learning about the natural sciences. 

Vision statement: Enjoyable and environmentally friendly! 

Motivation:This app would be useful to educate students about the natural sciences and bring more students into STEM based studies.

Risks: to project completion:
It would take a lot of time to make and we potentially might not finish
Using new programming languages
No prior experience working with the people on the team

Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk: This can be dealt with by creating a timeline and updating it at each milestone as well working together in order to gain experience with working in a team and with different programming languages. 


List of requirements: for the project
6 user stories
Each story must have a unique ID number
Written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”
Each requirement must have a size. You have two options for sizing:
Agile sizing – story points
Time estimate to complete
All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.

Methodology: Agile 
Project Tracking software:Trello 

GitHub Issues & Milestones
Link to project tracking software: make sure instructor and TAs have access https://trello.com/b/oPpdoATT/software-dev-team-project
Be sure to continue to use this throughout the semester! Even though these are small projects, the point is to practice the methodologies and tools used in industry!
Project plan: created from your Project Tracking software. Copy-paste the plan (or screenshot of) from your project tracking software into the repository.
