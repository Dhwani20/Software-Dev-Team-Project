FEEL FREE TO EDIT ANY PORTION OF THIS AS IT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY THURS 2/16 AT 6PM

Description: In this project, we will be making an app that allows users to connect with not only other users, but also engage students to go outside and interact with their surroundings, as well as have fun while learning about the natural sciences. 

Vision statement: To make learning about the natural sciences more effective and fun.

Motivation: This app would be useful to educate students about the natural sciences and bring more students into STEM based studies.

Risks:
It would take a lot of time to make and we potentially might not finish
Using new programming languages.
No prior experience working with the people on the team

Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk: This can be dealt with by creating a timeline and updating it at each milestone as well as working together in order to gain experience with working in a team and with different programming languages.

List of requirements:
6 user stories
Each story must have a unique ID number
Written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”
Each requirement must have a size. You have two options for sizing:
Agile sizing – story points
Time estimate to complete
All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.

User Stories:
1. As a teacher, I want help context so that my students can access information explaining the game science.
2. As a student, I want to be notified when in the vacinity of another player so that I can have the option to engage that player in competition.
3. As a student, I want a point system and character statistics so that I can track my progress and be more competative.
4. As a developer, I want to develop the wireframe of the components so that I can build the foundation of the graphic design.
5. As a developer, I want to establish mutation criteria so that I can establish when and how characters develop.
6. As a developer, I want to obtain and incorporate geographic data so that I can define the application's local environment.


Methodology: Waterfall 
Project Tracking software: Trello(add link) 

GitHub Issues & Milestones
Link to project tracking software: make sure instructor and TAs have access https://trello.com/b/oPpdoATT/software-dev-team-project
Be sure to continue to use this throughout the semester! Even though these are small projects, the point is to practice the methodologies and tools used in industry!
Project plan: created from your Project Tracking software. Copy-paste the plan (or screenshot of) from your project tracking software into the repository.
