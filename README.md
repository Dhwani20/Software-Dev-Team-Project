## by Dhwani Khatter - Dhwani20, Mario Ramirez - MiRamirezJr, Richard Li - rich4rdli, Josephina Hendrix - jrhendrix, Zachary Haney - zaha0077

### Description: 
LAWKI is a computer game meant to teach users about the natural sciences and encourage outdoor exploration. The game currently offers 5 characters to select from with information on biological organisms. Inside play mode, the user can move through the environment while their character's statistics change over time, distance, and based on the weather.
The game was created in Unity and is currently compatible with Mac. Later versions will be compatible with PC and Android.

### Organization of repo:
The project source code, assests, dependencies, and test cases are located on our GitHub page under LAWKI2. This folder also contains compiled versions of the game for Mac and Android as LAWKI_Mac and LAWKI.apk, respectively. Documentation on how to initiation automaticing testing of LAWKI is located in the TESTING.md file. 

### Build, Run, and Test code:
Building: Clone this repo and import LAWKI2 into Unity. Click File --> Build Setting. Select the intended platform and click Switch Platform if necessary. Then select Build. On the right hand side, specify the Target Platform. Select Build and Unity will compile a run file for the intended platform.

Running: After cloning this repo with the desired compiled file or building a file using the building instructions, select the run file that is compatible with the available platform and play.

Testing: Refer to TESTING.md for instructions on how to test the LAWKI code in Unity.

### CI System
We did not use a CI system.
 
### Vision statement: 
In this project, we will be making an app that allows users to connect with not only other users, but also engage students to go outside and interact with their surroundings, as well as have fun while learning about the natural sciences.
To make learning about the natural sciences more effective and fun.

### Motivation: 
This app would be useful to educate students about the natural sciences and bring more students into STEM based studies.

### Usage Instructions
Option 1: After cloning this repository, load LAWKI2 project into Unity.
Option 2: Pull compilation files and run on appropriate system. Use LAWKI_Mac.app for Mac, LAWKI_PC for PC, and LAWKI.apk for Android.

### Testing:
See TESTING.md for instructions on how to enable automated testing of system.

### Risks:
* It would take a lot of time to make and we potentially might not finish.
* Using new programming languages.
* No prior experience working with the people on the team.

### Dealing with the risk: 
This can be dealt with by creating a timeline and updating it at each milestone as well as working together in order to gain experience with working in a team and with different programming languages.

### List of requirements:
1. **(Estimate: 2hr)** As a teacher, I want helpful context so that my students can access information explaining the science used in the game.
2. **(Estimate: 6hr)** As a student, I want to be notified when in the vacinity of another player so that I can have the option to engage that player in competition. 
3. **(Estimate: 4hr)** As a student, I want a point system and character statistics so that I can track my progress and be more competative. 
4. **(Estimate: 5hr)** As a developer, I want to develop the wireframe of the components so that I can build the foundation of the graphic design. 
5. **(Estimate: 3hr)** As a developer, I want to establish mutation criteria so that I can establish when and how characters develop.  
6. **(Estimate: 4hr)** As a developer, I want to obtain and incorporate geographic data so that I can define the application's local environment.
