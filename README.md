Description: Short description of the project (help explain to us what you are doing)

Vision statement: (what you would tell potential customers) Be sure to follow the guidelines from lecture!

Motivation:This app would be useful to educate students about the natural sciences and bring more students into STEM based studies 

Risks: to project completion:
It would take a lot of time to make and we potentially might not finish
Using new programming languages
No prior experience working with the people on the team

Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk


List of requirements: for the project
6 user stories
Each story must have a unique ID number
Written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”
Each requirement must have a size. You have two options for sizing:
Agile sizing – story points
Time estimate to complete
All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.

Methodology: Agile 
Project Tracking software:Trello 

GitHub Issues & Milestones
Link to project tracking software: make sure instructor and TAs have access https://trello.com/b/oPpdoATT/software-dev-team-project
Be sure to continue to use this throughout the semester! Even though these are small projects, the point is to practice the methodologies and tools used in industry!
Project plan: created from your Project Tracking software. Copy-paste the plan (or screenshot of) from your project tracking software into the repository.
